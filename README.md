# 📈 Linear Regression from Scratch (1D & 3D)

This repository contains two educational Python projects that implement **Linear Regression from scratch** using **gradient descent**. These examples are fully manual — no external machine learning libraries like `scikit-learn` are used — to help you learn how regression and optimization actually work under the hood.

## 🚀 1. 1D Linear Regression from CSV

### 📄 Description

This project loads a dataset from a CSV file (`score.csv`) and fits a linear model:

\[
Y = A \cdot X + B
\]

The gradient descent is implemented manually. You will see how the model converges over iterations to fit a line minimizing mean squared error.

### 🧠 Key Concepts
- Single-variable regression
- Manual computation of gradient descent
- Plotting model vs data

### 📦 Requirements
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
````

### ▶️ How to Run

```bash
python 1d_linear_regression.py
```

### 📷 Output

## 🌐 2. 3D Linear Regression with Synthetic Data

### 📄 Description

This project:

* Generates **1000 synthetic 2D-feature data points** using a known linear equation
* Adds random noise to simulate real-world conditions
* Trains a linear model on this dataset using **gradient descent**
* Plots the regression **plane in 3D**

### 📈 Model

$$
Y = W_1 \cdot X_1 + W_2 \cdot X_2 + b
$$

Training is done on **normalized features** to ensure better convergence.

### 🧠 Key Concepts

* Multivariate regression (2 features)
* Synthetic data generation
* Feature normalization
* Manual loss minimization
* 3D visualization

### 📦 Requirements

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

### ▶️ How to Run

```bash
python 3d_linear_regression.py
```

### 📷 Output

## 🎯 Learning Goals

* Understand how gradient descent updates weights and bias
* Learn to normalize data for stable convergence
* Visualize regression lines and planes
* See the difference between 1D and multivariate regression
* Build everything **from scratch** without ML libraries

---

## 🧠 How Gradient Descent Works (Summary)

For both 1D and 3D versions, the model parameters (weights and bias) are updated using:

$$
W := W - \alpha \cdot \frac{\partial L}{\partial W}
\quad\quad
b := b - \alpha \cdot \frac{\partial L}{\partial b}
$$

Where:

* $L$ is the Mean Squared Error loss
* $\alpha$ is the learning rate

Ideas to explore:

* Add a loss plot (loss vs. epochs)
* Try using polynomial features (nonlinear regression)
* Implement early stopping
* Compare with `scikit-learn`'s `LinearRegression`
